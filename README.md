# PyAnimeList-Shuffle
MyAnimeList shuffle script using python

#### This is my **first** python project, ever.
The code is a joke, but I tried my best.

As you can see in the gif below, this projects relies heavily on [Jikan](https://jikan.moe/), an unofficial MyAnimeList API.
To prevent spam requests, every page (300 elements of your list) is fetched no sooner that 6 seconds after the other.
